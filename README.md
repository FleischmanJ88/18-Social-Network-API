# 18-Social-Network-API

## <strong>Description</strong>

For Module 18, we are tasked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong>

    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list


## <strong>Criteria Met</strong>

♦ Successfully navigate through the /users, /thoughts, and IDs of this task. However, unable to make the Delete functions work properly. Some routing issues, ran out of time.
